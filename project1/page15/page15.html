    <p id="eight">O, let America be 
    America again--</p>
    The land that never has been yet--
    And yet must be--the land where every man is free.
    The land that's mine--the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME--
    <p id="six">Who made America,
    Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
    Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
    </p>
    Must bring back our mighty dream again.
